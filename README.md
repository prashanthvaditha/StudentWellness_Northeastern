# Northeastern University Wellness Initiative

## Project Overview

This project supports Northeastern Universityâ€™s campaign to promote wellness and healthy lifestyles among students. The goal is to use machine learning techniques to analyze lifestyle features and categorize students based on their health-related behaviors. Insights from this analysis will guide the university's wellness initiatives, addressing challenges like nutrition, physical activity, and exposure to alcohol and smoking.

Key components include:
- Analyzing factors like diet, exercise, and water consumption.
- Categorizing students into obesity risk levels.
- Comparing machine learning models to select the best approach.
